### Author: Goncharov Mark (EverRest) ###

There is a new brand game! Yep, right now it can be donloaded and played by whose have VS 2017+ , SFML 2.5.1 - in that case you can clone it and check (now, there is no garantee that game will launch on your pc)

This topic will be updated after some time - check it (if you want). Release of the game will be on my VK page: https://vk.com/id138511474 (I assume it september 2020)

Right now this article isn't written fully. Just check programms and pictures that I have now)))

Pictures: folder Pictures... (you didn't wait , did you?)
Programm:
	
*	Actions: main functions that manupulate the game
*	Map: Map, Prototypes of map, using it and so on
*	Images: Useful images (something i didn't use, but i look at them)
*	Objects: tank, bullets and so on
*	Fonts: pretty fonts)

*	Help: so useful functions, structers, constants - there is array_dim2)))
